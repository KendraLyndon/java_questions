### Java Cracking the Coding interview style questions 


### Objective  
Given a cracking the coding interview problem, write a solution in Java


### Method: 
This is designed to be a WHITEBOARD interview. This test suite is for the instructor to plug into the IntervewQuestions.class  file the answers written on the whiteboard by the student, then run the test suite to ensure that the questions are correct. 


The instructor running these tests does not have to know Java, but should be able to reason through the problems enough to give feedback. Instructor should also be able to reason through how to plug the student given solution into the IntervewQuestions.class
